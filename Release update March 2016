- troubleshooted the initial hardware
- found that the contrast potentiometer was intermittent, and when it went open, the display became blank even though the backlight continued to function as expected.
- hence, the potentiometer was disconnected and replaced with fixed resistors.  Left the potentiometer on the board, just because that was easier than removing it.
- updated the schematic to reflect this

- merged pull request commit 620bc66 from Kent McBride, bumped the software version ID and ran verification
